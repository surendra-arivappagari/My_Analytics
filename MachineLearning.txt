Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.
It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data",
in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
